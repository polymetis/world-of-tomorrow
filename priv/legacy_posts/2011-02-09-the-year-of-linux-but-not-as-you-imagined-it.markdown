Some time ago, a non-computer oriented friend asked me about Linux. I am guessing this takes place some time around early 2008 because I remember I was running Fedora full time and somewhat pining for a Mac.

Essentially the conversation boiled down to that he was unhappy with Vista and was wondering if he could just switch to Linux. My answer was no.

He simply could not just because it was not easy to run Linux at the time; or even now for that matter. He needed support, tutorials, and a system that did not require you to go into the command line. I did know that some people were successful living this kind of life style with Ubuntu but if something broke the fora would usually tell you to jump into terminal. For a guy where word is complicated for him Linux could not solve his computing needs. What he needed to do reliably.

He then asked if Linux would ever be ready for normal people without a geeky friend. My prediction was that Linux is already ready on some levels but what is needed is the hardware manufactures — my list was HP, Sony, and Dell — needed to decide that Microsoft products were somehow devaluing their product.

It looks like that day has come. Although I was only vaguely interested in the TouchPad but I was surprised that HP annocued them scaling it up to their desktops and laptops. This is kinda of the reverse of what Apple did but the intergration is still there.

If HP manages to field this OS into the market I think the days of Microsoft supremacy may be coming to a close. I can already see Sony fiddling with Android and if HP is successful in their run I can think of no reason for Sony to stay if they think they can better deal with Android.

Well do think this is beginning of the end for Microsoft market-share dominance or just a soon to be failed experiment?
