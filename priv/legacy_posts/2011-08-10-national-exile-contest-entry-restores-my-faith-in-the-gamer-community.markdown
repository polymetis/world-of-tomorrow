Recently I learnt that the Duke Nukem apparently ended up in the black despite the fact that every critic on Earth panned it for good reason. This lead to the obvious depression that 'Gamers' were obviously a bunch of porridge brained idiots that can easily amused by jingling your keys in front of the as long as you keychain had a scantly clad woman on it. 

Then I logged into to Google Plus and the top post in my feed, by [Leigh Alexander](http://sexyvideogameland.blogspot.com/), linked me to this wonderful video for the recent Valve contest. In short, this has restored my faith that some, although a very small group, of gamers actually care about art.
