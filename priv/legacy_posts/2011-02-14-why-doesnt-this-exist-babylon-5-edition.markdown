This morning, over tea, I was enjoying my little re-watch of Babylon 5. I love this show a great deal and I think that it is one of the best examples of television writing out there. I know it is not the most popular show in existence, probably due to a painful pilot and middling first season, but those that like it are nearly rabid about the show.

All this means is that the two things that I am about to purpose has an audience and a predictable sales count. So without further ado : Â Why don't these exist?

##Babylon 5 2.0

Sure there is a problem with the Buffy master tapes due to the first season being shot on 16 mm but Babylon does not have this handicap. It was shot Super 35mm with widescreen in mind. The only problem is that the special effects were done on an Amiga and have not aged well.

So why not just redo the special effects with modern computers and release something like remastered [The Original Star Trek series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_2.0#Remastered_series). You could cash in on both a rebroadcast with some network and the new sales from at least an optical release, before those vanish, and a digital release.

Not to say that the originals should be destroyed but any fan could easily have both versions and squabble about which is better.

##The Complete Scripts: Digital Edition

About 5 years ago, there was a release of a [15 volume set of the Scripts and notes concerning the series](http://www.cafepress.ca/b5books "I want these so Bad"). They are currently doing one off lottery draws of the remaining prints but I can not understand why there is no digital version. If there is obviously a ridculously high demand, $1000 for used copies, why have these not been thrown up on the Amazon Kindle store. Even a digital store could be set up to sell an epub or pdf copies of the things.

This could easily generate money with little cost; in fact no cost, except profit sharing, if they were release on ibooks or the kindle store.

And it is not link they have to be retyped or anything. This was done in 2006 so there must a computer file which could be reformatted or just printed as pdf for gods sake.

Even the extra money aside it would be a valuable resource for those that want to write good television.

So I ask the rights holders: Why don't these exist?
