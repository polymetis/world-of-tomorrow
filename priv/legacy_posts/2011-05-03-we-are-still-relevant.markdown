>The other is technological wizardry: young people who have grown up with laptops in their hands instead of remote controls are opting not to buy TV sets when they graduate from college or enter the work force, at least not at first. Instead, they are subsisting on a diet of television shows and movies from the Internet.

>Similarly, the economy was the reason cited by Nielsen when the percentage of homes with sets declined in 1992. That decline, the company’s report says, “also followed a prolonged recession and was reversed during the economic upswing of the mid-1990s.” 

I do enjoy it when companies that refuse to change their business models try to defend themselves when they can see the own obsolesces off on the horizon. 

What Nielsen is trying to say is that everything will get better but their own reports suggests that the young professional crowd is moving away from the model which works for them. Worse yet the young professional crowd, you know the group with disposable income that advertisers like to target, are moving towards a model the can be easily tracked through simple site statistics and worse yet are paying for the privilege to avoid ads.

Nielsen's relevancy dwindling is a good thing for television as an art because if each television show was only subjected to viewer numbers rather than whether or not advertisers are willing to be associated with it, we will get fewer first season innovative show cancellations.
