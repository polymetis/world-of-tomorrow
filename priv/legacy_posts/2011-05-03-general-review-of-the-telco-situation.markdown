The very fact that they are interchangeable is what I want to focus on but from a different angle. I am going to name names but my difference is that because I am light user there is no way around my problem because there is absolutely no way to hurt the 'service' providers. 

In short, I am deeply annoyed with Roger's cellar service. I am a very minimal user and the best they could do for me is a 10 dollar a month pay as you go plan, which seems antithetical to the very concept of pay as go. They also charged me for a Sim card because I had the gaul of already owning a phone. This annoyed me but at the time they were the only GSM carrier in my region.

In addition to that, I happen to like paying my bills online and Rogers has consistently been making their website less and less usable over time. 

Recently, however, Bell has gained GSM service and I went into a store to see what they were offering. They have a slightly better plan, which required me to give them 100 dollars a year but the per minute rate is only 30 cents rather than 40 cents rogers is charging me. Still they also wanted to charge me for a sim card. Whatever the amount is for the sim card, I forget the exact price, put the cost of switching to Bell over the price of just staying with Rogers. When I said as much to the poor girl at the store she just gave a bit of shrug. 

I don't get it. 

Does Bell not want my 100 dollars or would they just rather Rogers have the business?
