Gah!

Okay it seems Natasha Simons wrote about Buffy and Firefly as well. So instead editing my earlier post to deal with this I am going to deal with each one in its own separate post. Ha so there. Wait do I win? 

>Buffy, for all her killing vamps and breaking stuff, is rather a weak character ... And Buffy is textually[sic] weak in all her relationships. She falls apart not only when Angel leaves her, but when Parker (yeah, you don’t remember him, either) doesn’t want to pursue more than a one-night stand with her, too. And Riley, well. Riley. Despite being an almost universally despised character, Whedon sends Riley out in a flurry of pique at Buffy, after being caught having his blood sucked by a vampiress in a modern-day opium den ... She reacts with the appropriate level of scorn, before Xander, the Chronicler of Buffy’s Failures, lectures her on her failure as a girlfriend to Riley, her lack of adequate emotional support ...

I don't think I win. 

Okay as I mentioned in the last post, but in response to her third page for those keeping track, the concept of Buffy is derived from : "Cute blonde suburban cheerleader destroys monsters instead of the other way around." 

She is still a young person. She will still make mistakes and at times she is a little narcissistic. Aren't we all?

Would it be helpful to the plot, or be entertaining, that she be old and wise from birth? Seriously what is the complaint. 

>Let’s consider that she, as a Slayer, descends from a line that was literally created by men – a formation that stems directly from the male anxiety over an inability to create life the way that women do. And inherently problematic is the idea of the Watcher, a predominantly male presence that is the male gaze made manifest ...

The what now. Seriously I am all for digging deep but this reading just is not there. There is nothing to support it. It seems to me that it is male inadequacy is rather prevalent in the shows mythos. 

In fact Xander, Spike, Riley, Angel, and Giles all seem to have some deficiency of character. An inability to cope alone.

Oh wait, that is most people in general. This is just a theme in Whedon's work. We are stronger together than alone. It is slightly intensified because the characters are younger and prone to more mistakes.

>As has been pointed out by the magnificent Buffy scholar Eleusis Walks (to whose blog you should go post haste following this article), Faith is essentially a foil for Buffy, her shadow self. Whereas Buffy has approved-by-Whedon sex with her steadfast boyfriends whom she loves, Faith is a sexual free agent.

True except for the "Whedon approved" sex thing. 

Buffy is a suburban teen/20 something. She takes on the ideas of that culture. I think it would be odd that a suburban teenager would have a fully developed thought pattern on how to handle sexual relationships with no experience. 

In fact I have always been in the minority of people that did not like Buffy as much as it seems I should, according to all the people around me. I always felt that Whedon didn't mine the whole very powerful person in disaffected America as deep as he should have.

Still I don't think this critique holds much water.
