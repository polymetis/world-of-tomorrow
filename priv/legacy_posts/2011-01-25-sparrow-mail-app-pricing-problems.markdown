If you are a Mac Gmail user chances are that you have heard of Sparrow Mail by this point and chances are you have seen the recent uproar concerning [the proposed price](http://blog.sparrowmailapp.com/post/2908697184/sparrow1-0 "Sparrow Blog").The good people that make Sparrow have already replied and [might be reconsidering](https://twitter.com/#!/sparrowmailapp/status/29663630463074304) their pricing scheme but still I think there is more to the uproar than their user base being stingy. So here are my thoughts.

A few weeks back I had a conversation with another Sparrow user about what the price for the software should be. He was honestly fine with the ad version and all the power to him but I would prefer to support the developers directly and I spend a lot of time in my email client so I would prefer not to have such a large add placed at the top of my inbox. Still I gauged the value of sparrow, based on its current feature list to be somewhere between 10 and 15 dollars. 10 being what I considered to be a fair price and 15 being what I would grudgingly pay.

I am not cheap and honestly I only have the one email account that I use with any frequency so I could use the free one but there is a reason why I am pricing it so low and that is because the breathing space for the Sparrow Mail has already been taken up by not just one decent client but two.

Sparrow has to compete with Mail.app and it has to compete with the Gmail web interface which are both quite useable and to further complicate things it is not able to complete supplant either of them completely.

Sparrow mail Â is limited to gmail, at the moment, but will always be limited to imap whereas Mail.app can handle other protocols readily. Mail.app has some other features which I don't use but some people might want to use that Sparrow would probably never be able to replicate. (e.g, Stationery)

To further complicate matters Sparrow can not fully replace Gmail's web interface either. It cannot create filters, at least that I am aware of, and that means I still have to log into gmail every time I need to adjust them.

This is not to say that Sparrow is not my favourite email client that I have used in a long time. I especially like that I can label email, albeit manually, and that I can use Apple shortcuts and Gmail shortcuts at the same time. I also find the UI design to be top notch but still I price the software a bit lower because there were two free alternatives that I will still have to us anyway.

Netscape was suffocated out of existence by IE despite being a great deal better than IE. Sparrow is trying to break into a market that already has two heavy breathers in the room. Maybe a lower price point will be their oxygen tank.
