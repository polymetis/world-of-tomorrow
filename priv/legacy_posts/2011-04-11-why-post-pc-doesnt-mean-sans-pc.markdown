Although the article is good I am slightly annoyed with the analysis of the prefix *post* here. 

When post is attached to some term it usually means "is but no longer recognizable as". For instance Post-Modernism is not after modernism but rather a "a type of modernism that is very different from the earlier form". It is associating itself with modernism ;  as part of the continuity.  

The same goes for the Ipad. It is a PC but no longer recognizable as a PC. It is a personal device that does some of the stuff that computer does but in an unrecognizable, as a computer, way. Well that point is debatable but I think is is what Apple is going after with the new term.
