Although this video perfectly sums up a particularly British form evangelical atheism which irritates me it has made me realize why [Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/) bothers me more than a standard religious or new age zealot. 

The reason is because Dawkins, and the author of this poem, can in fact change their mind. You could win the argument therefore there is a reason to fight. A religious person, at the best of times, will simply just pretend that you are not talking. 

This realization comes with the baggage that apparently I have just given up on a large section of humanity. 

On a happier note, the video also reminded me of an argument I had with a priest (Greek Orthodox). Eventually we hit a juncture point in the argument, which was about whether or not the Church should be subjected to taxation, where he needed to use God to support he argument against(My argument was that they should simply have to prove their 'good works' like any other charity and I don't think that 'The Christ' would be particularly against that). 

Unlike Minchin though I did not go through a long tirade at that point on why my world view was better. I pinched the priests cheek and called him cute in the way you would a child. 

Mine is less poetic but possibly more practical.
