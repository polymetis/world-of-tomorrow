Not so long ago, Nathan Fillion did an interview with [EW](http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/02/17/firefly-returns/ "Entertainment Weekly") saying that if he had a won the California lottery he would buy the rights to the Firefly.

The fan response was unusually enthusiastic and there seemed to be more than a few to many people wanting to collect money so that Nathan Fillion could buy the show. I am force to ask, Why?

Not to say that I don't like Nathan Fillion. He is one of the major reasons I started watching Castle - well that and the fact that I have a thing for Stana Katic.

Also I happen to agree that Fox is not the appropriate custodian of this show. They didn't know how to handle it on the air, canceled it, and yet continue to make money from it depsite those facts which irritates me greatly.

But if the fans of Firefly are going to unite around buying the rights to the show why not crowd source the money to buy the rights to the show for *yourselves*.

Seriously, treat it like stock in a company. Just hire a lawyer, or whatever entity is needed to negotiate the price for the rights, and then collect money. The person that puts the most money would be the majority share holder and you could just put Joss Whedon, or even Nathan Fillion, as the creative equivalent of the CEO.

Then you could all vote and fund another season if all the players can be placed, or make an animated show, or do nothing other than stop giving Fox your money every time time a new format comes out. Or to put it words that may be vaguely more appropriate.

Fox took the sky from you. Take it back.
