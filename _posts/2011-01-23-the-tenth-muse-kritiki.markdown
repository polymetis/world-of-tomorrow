This started as a little late addendum to my [Citizen Kane of Video Games article](http://www.worldoftomorrow.ca/2010/04/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/). The reason for my sudden renewed interest is because at the time of writing the [*Citizen Kane*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/) piece I had yet to play the [*Half Life 2*](http://orange.half-life2.com/) series and I feel like that was an error on my behalf. In order to rectify this I will simply write about the things that can be found in the *Half Life* series that may be helpful at advancing the medium as an art form which I did not talk about in the original article and beyond that have a bit of a rethink about the Citizen Kane analogy.

##I'm Sorry I Couldn't Quite Make That Out

The first and most obvious narrative device is that *Half Life* series has is a silent protagonist. The advantage of keeping your protagonist mute is that you can better integrate player and character and there are many ways to keep you character mute. [Bioware’s](http://www.bioware.com/), and other rpg makers, standard approach is that we are presented with a very particular character which has been completely created by us. [Gordon Freeman](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gordon_Freeman) is somewhat different, however, in a positive way. We have only seen a small portion of his life but at the same time we know him quite well and do get hints of a life lived outside of the confines of the invisible walls and still this is not quite the avatar presented in the [*Metroid*](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_series) series that I talked about [earlier](http://www.worldoftomorrow.ca/2010/04/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/).

[Samus](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Samus_Aran "Metroid's Protagonist") is quite different than Gordon beyond just being a different gender. Until recently, and I will not include [*Other M*](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Other_M) with the rest of the series, Samus is a pretty much a blank slate that had some information plugged in by the gameplay. You never really get the sense that she existed outside of the world that we were presented. Sure there are some references of a life lived in the [*Zero Mission*](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Zero_Mission) game and [*Fusion*](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion) but even those referenced stories seemed to only be rather boring interludes between the *Metroid* games. Samus’ important stories are all experienced directly and all those stories are extraordinary.  Given that she is an intergalactic bounty hunter, this is hardly surprising and I would also say that Link is similar in this regard.

Gordon is not an intergalactic bounty hunter. As [Breen](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Wallace_Breen) aptly put it, he barely had his Ph.D.before being thrown into the mess of the *Half Life* universe. The ordinary section of Gordon’s life is there for us to assume and understand due to the fact that he is somewhat similar to us.  For instance, when [Eli Vance]("http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Eli_Vance) start [to explain the state of the world to Gordon](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_2_storyline#Black_Mesa_East) there is no to little back story telling how much Gordon liked or disliked his co-workers or any other diarrhetic exposition because we all have lived a life that has that sort of thing that we can imagine what work was like before the original [*Half-Life*](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life) game started. We are already grounded in that type of reality and this type of less-is-more narrative style allows for the player to insert elements of his own life with certain limits. Similar to the pathology of ‘that guy’ at the party that always fills in the bits to your interesting story — correctly.

This is also why there is [that fairly long scene](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half_life_storyline#Black_Mesa_Inbound "Black Mesa Inbound - Half Life") in the first *Half Life* which consisted of Gordon running around normal tasks and being a bit of prankster. It is not merely tutorial that informs us how to play but it is also grounding us in the ordinary that allows us to fill in the blanks with our own life. Also this little scene allows not just us to experience the extraordinary but also Gordon when the true game begins. This is way of fusing our and his personalities in a unique way. It differs from the experience in [*Metroid Prime*](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_prime) because we are never entirely sure of Samus’ reaction to anything without the aid of a scream or severe pantomime. Gordon doesn’t even have the aide of pantomime but we know that he is a fairly normal guy, likes to have beer, and works in a normalish type of job. So other than the occasional grunt of pain we can judge, with some accuracy,  the emotional resonance of the scene through our own psyche.

The beginning of the *Half Life 2*, however, has a different way of integrating our psyche into the immediate extraordinary which is also worth noting for those plots that do not have ability to start in an office space. The train ride and opening scene are distinctly formed to feed on the ideas of totalitarianism that lie around western liberal society. In the same way that the infamous [1984 Apple Ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN6eFGGHrXs) we feel like we are under one of any number of regimes that are imagined with the vocative big bother fused with reality of Eastern European and Soviet imagery. This short introduction to the world immediately tells us everything we need to know about the principle players of the universe that are new through our own  href="">[Orwellian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "Really? Come On!") - cold war cultural *leitmotifs*. When we finally see Barney we encounter home once again and are firmly grounded as a xenotype to this universe rather than being the a defender against the xenotypes that we were in the first game.

##Without Friends No One Would Choose to Live

Personally, I felt that *Half Life 2* had a tendency to drag on in places. This is not because of poor writing but rather my own version of ADD, I am somewhat like [Johnny 5](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/ "Short Circuit") and need constant narrative input, coupled with the fact I do not like the FPS games all that much in general. This is not to say I didn’t enjoy the game but I felt after a while in the [Water Hazard](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_2_storyline#Water_Hazard "Water Hazard - Half Life 2") level I was just waiting, and waiting, and then waiting some more just to get to the god damn story to start again. Mind you there were things keeping me entertained but I found that the pacing was a little off there and a few other spots which drew attention to the 'long corridor'.

This was thankfully fixed in the first episode by the entrance of [Alyx Vance](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Alyx_Vance) as a persistent *relatable* companion. Which could have easily ended up as being an annoying feature if she either dragged Gordon through the plot, which [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) discovered was a problem in beta, or if she was not so carefully written. The first point is that we have to believe that Alyx can exist in our world not just the world of *Half Life 2*. Valve accomplishes this feat, which [Square-Enix](http://www.square-enix.com/) has not be able to do since the days of the [SNES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_vi "Final Fantasy VI"), by giving her reactions that would also function in our world without the demands of the a [Combine](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Combine) run world.

When the [Stalker train crashes](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_one_storyline#Direct_Intervention "Direct Intervention - Half Life 2 Episode 1") and she is stuck under one of the Stalkers that is screaming in her face she reacts the way anyone would. She also seems shaken right after which again does not make her some weak female character it just somebody would react under those circumstances. Just think of your reaction if they took the face of a stalker screaming and put in a close focal distance up on the screen. I don’t think I would be as shaken but I do think the chair would have rolled back a couple of feet. I also remember an instantly charming scene,[during the Lowlife chapter](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_one_storyline#Lowlife "Lowlife - Half Life 2 Episode 1"), when I was charging my flashlight she was obviously making zombie noises. I quickly clicked on my flashlight and shone it on her and from the acting of the character to the switching from a Zombie impression to the gotcha face. It is hard to imagine anyone not smiling after that. Also, her bad “zombine” joke made me laugh. Fine, she is not [Noël Coward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noël_Coward "Him too?") but she is not some action hero cliché either. She is a character that we get to know and become affectionate towards despite and in fact because of her foibles.

All of that makes her the rare success in a video game characterization. The failure of most video games is that they want to make all their characters to have pure liquid awesome pumping through the characters cardiovascular system. Fine enough but that leads to what most people call comic book writing. If your protagonist, or any character for that matter, is too competent it makes for great escapism but also creates a problem for believability and drama.

This is not a new idea. In fact it an idea that is in the western tradition very foundations. In [the Illiad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad), when [Hector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector) confronts the full rage of [Achilles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles) does he say “it has only just begun” or give some sort of hand gesture to show that he is ready for the climatic battle? For those of you that have not read the Iliad the answer is no. He does what a sensible man would do when be confronted by a fully armed enraged Greek man comes running at you. He high tales it. This does not detract form Hector’s position as a hero. In fact it intensifies it. From Hector’s reaction we can understand the awesome sight of the rage of Achilles and then we are moved even more when Hector turns to confront him. Hector is afraid to die and the fact that he is willing to confront Achilles is what makes him a hero. His willing to confront death is what makes him heroic. The very capacity to have fear and overcome is heroic which is why is was important that Alyx be able to show fear especially given the fact that Gordon can not express any emotion. Alyx is behaving, like Hector, as an emotional surrogate.

##What Fools These Mortals Be

Furthermore, from the Iliad, if you were examine the story of the gods as a plot device you see the failure of have pure liquid awesome, the Greeks called it ichor, flowing through your veins. The gods are involved in the war but Homer always uses the divine narrative as a way *to relieve* tension from the ongoing trails and tribulation of the mortal heros. The gods have nothing important at stake so they can not demonstrate anything of importance. They can just force plot points and act as clowns in the background.

Gordon Freeman and Alyx, since her death ends with a game over screen, can not die either. Sure your health bar can hit zero but you can just reload and try again. Some may mistake this as godhood of the two characters and I have seen some people claim that the protagonists have the rules of bend around them because of this feature but this a merely a superficial look and it is important to see the difference in an active narrative.

Hector can not die until Achilles kills him despite the fact that everyone knows that he is going to die by the end of Book 7. Achilles death is not even in the Iliad but we a constantly reminded that his choices through out the tale will result in his death. The is problem with plot is, unless you believe in fate or that the [Train of History is very hard to derail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace "War and Peace"), characters only die when it narratively useful which to be honest given the randomness of death around us in reality I sometimes yearn for, ever so desperately, for death of my loved ones to narratively useful.

Which is the  something that Square-Enix used to be good at. [Crono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crono#Crono), from [*Chrono Trigger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger), and [Aerith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough), from [*Final Fantasy VII*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII), both die at certain points where it is narratively useful but also allow for the plots of both games to absorb the shock of a playable character dying and to heal around that point. Mind you in the case of non party based games it would be impossible to confront true death without needless metaphysical intervention.

The problem is that hunting season on playable characters never seemed to open up all that much. In fact it seems to have closed altogether since the introduction of voice actors and in my opinion this is probably the worst thing to happen to the narrative quality of games with the exception of the financial success of Popcap. I am not saying that every game should kill off a playable character in the first act but there are some great stories that could be written, that do not exist right now, if this was a more often used option.

##If, Then, Else

One of the few things that I think Valve does not utilize in their work is [active conditional narrative storytelling which I touched on in the first article](http://www.1337philosophxorz.com/2010/07/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/). The *Half Life* series seems to suffer from the 'long corridor' syndrome of most video games which would be fine if it were making a [Tolstoyan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Now you are just depressing me") type game that had very idea of the 'long corridor' integrated into the moral of the tale.  Otherwise being stuck on the rails of particular plot is very noticeable in video games because the limits of the invisible walls goes against the normal limits of reality.

This is not to say that they ignored conditionality completely. Again, it was appropriated by Alyx and according to Valve she adapts to your playing style so there is a certain perception of the incalculable that we would have in our real relationships. Now Alyx is not really incalculable. In fact she is ridiculously calculable but the illusion is there within her algorithms. I believe that Valve called this “personality code”. If this idea, and hopefully the code as well, could be ported towards how the plot unfolds then there would be a real victory for active character development which I honestly think would open the flood gates for the medium as a whole.

##The World as a Stage

The *Half Life 2* world is also worth noting and from the commentary tracks you get the sense of how much care that Half Life team puts into the vistas their games provide. In fact the most interesting bit in the commentaries is how much work they have done in order to draw the attention to the player to particular events happening around the sets in the games and their use of large landmarks for narrative purposes is also impressive. If you have not played through the episodes with the commentary tracks then you are really missing something in the art direction required for set design in a world where the Camera is unhinged. In fact some of the tricks that I found in [*Beyond Good and Evil*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil) were used in *Half Life* I think the direction would be near perfect.

Setting, however, is not merely how things look but also the narrative of the world itself and in the *Half Life* world is one of the better examples. Mind you, as I stated before, there is some heavy borrowing from Orwell, and some [Michael Crichton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton "Sigh, He wrote Jurassic Park") but it is still a strong enough set of ideas to stand up on their own. Which is fairly important not simply because of the standard “what are the stakes” questions that creative executives like to talk about but more because if narrative conditionality ever takes off the setting will become the natural limits of the plot and keep writers sane. Essentially conditional narrative would make the plot more fluid and the setting would have to act a container and the plot would obviously be limited to the shape of that container.

##And Are We but Players?

Using *Half Life 2* series as a mirror for my reflections on Video Games are am no longer entirely convinced that what video games, as an art, needs is a Citizen Kane. In fact I think the medium is dire need of an Iliad and despite the fact that Valve has done a great deal for the conventions and grammar they still fall a little short of such a work.

Despite the fact that I say that *Citizen Kane* is a story that can only be shown there is still a long tradition of western passive narrative conventions for it to feed upon, hence my claiming it to be Faust with just enough Freud to make it seem more modern, but in active storytelling I am beginning to feel that we are a little bit lost. The ‘long corridor’ is more detrimental to stories than it is in the more traditional mediums. *Final Fantasy X*, artlessly, tried to copy the whole rosebud thing for about ninety percent of the plot and it quite simply did not work. We play games but we are not told games.

Which is why there needs to be a something of an *Iliad* for the medium. The *Iliad* and the [*Odyssey*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) are the prototypes for all western fiction. Go and read a non western influenced book like the epic of [*Gilgamesh*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh). I’ll wait — see didn’t that feel odd. Doesn’t quite jive with our expectations of how a story should work and that is even with the aid of translation. Now go out and read Homer’s work. I’ll wait — see much better, right? Even with a few glaring anachronisms. Homer’s work has most of the ingredients that are necessary to construct a good a story and it could be said that all authors, in the western tradition, live in Homer’s shadow. Much as most philosophers live in Socrates’ shadow.

In the past artists have always been working with new forms of grammar and style to mimic the ideas and concepts hidden in the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* to varying success but the one fall back was that each author could behave as narrator of the story. The problem with an active medium, like video games, is that we have to venture away from Homer himself. The narrator is causing problems because it is in competition with another narrator. That of the player.

To illustrate, the word hypocrite comes from an old word for actor. The intended meaning was that the actor’s ability to judge , critic, was underneath the play itself. They were restrained by the plot and everything else despite being artists in their own regards. Now this is true of all artists, a painter can only paint with materials available to him for instance, but the audience was never supposed to be aware of this. This is a problem for a video game player because we are the intended audience and yet we are asked to take on some of the roles of an artist. To be dragged along by the plot is not a good feeling, something Valve discovered early with Alyx Vance’s script, and all the fights between actors, directors, and writers can easily illustrate that point. Even given this the guiding hand of narrator can have a soft touch and Valve is particularly good at this but I am still forced to asked is this necessarily what we want? Will always be the task of the writers to hide the narrator as much as possible? Will video games always be necessarily fatalistic due to the demands of western narrative conventions.

Homer never had a problem with the fates. He and Tolstoy would have gotten along famously. Achilles fate was sealed long before the *Iliad* even begun and we a constantly reminded of that fact through the epic but in today’s age where our culture swirls along the ideas of freedom, social mobility, and choice I don’t think that, without a specific artistic reason, that we should be reflecting Homeradic themes on fate even if its merely unintentional due to requirements of the audience as an actor.

In my, less than humble, opinion a games goal should make the audience hypercritical and emphasis choice and judgement. Even if the choices, actual choices that have mutual exclusivity and each have pros and cons, do lead you down remarkably different paths the difference between these paths could be the point.

If we were to rewrite the *Iliad* with this in mind we could simply allow Achilles to chose to go to war to win glory or to chose to stay home and live a long life. The difference between these lives could be the very point of the Iliad and to be hones it already is. The *Iliad* constantly contrasts the peaceful pastural life with the horrors of war. This is part of the reason it endures to today. The *Iliad* is not just a tale of war but it is really more the tale of both war and peace and I think it makes us decide on what we want out of life. A world where fathers bury their sons or a world where we die old in our beds surround by our progeny.

Video games need to stop being about a particular plot. They need to stop being stories about unique individuals making specific choices. The art form needs a tale that is about what we are, and what we want to be, through our very choices.
