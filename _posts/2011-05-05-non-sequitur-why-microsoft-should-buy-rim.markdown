I am beginning to think that logic has just fallen wayside despite the rise in university attendance. 

[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/05/microsoft-rim) has already beat me to the punch on why Microsoft *will* not buy RIM(Although I would like to remind people of the [Nokia situation](http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/11/nokia/)). I still think that Fabrice Taylor actually shows in this very article the reason why.  

>Microsoft's problem is similar to RIM's. It's not exactly a hotbed of innovation. When is the last time it invented anything? It spent billions on music players, smart phones, the Xbox and other things, with results ranging from complete failure (in most cases) to questionable success in others (notably Xbox).

So why would they buy a company that is having the same problems they are? What value does it add to Microsoft to buy this company? 

>[RIM]pretty much invented the smart phone and had the market all to itself for almost a decade.

Okay, but those days are over and RIM clearly ran out of ideas and the main reason to buy a company is because there will be future dividends. Although I grant that being able to break into the tablet market would be great for Microsoft the Playbook is not the best solution for them for a great many reasons. 

>Both companies share an irksome problem called Apple ... Apple spent $580-million on R&D in the most recent quarter, compared with RIM's $380-million ... [Microsoft]spent billions on music players, smart phones, the Xbox and other things, with results ranging from complete failure (in most cases) to questionable success in others (notably Xbox).

Ah I see. Well no it not the budget that is problem. It's the approach and that is obvious given the fact that both Microsoft who has spent billions on R&D and RIM are having the same problem.

As the the xbox has shown if you throw enough money at a problem it can be a solved but that only works as staling mechanism for long term growth of an already healthy company. 

The difference between Apple and the other two is their R&D works on a specific device through the eyes of human interaction with that device. Then Apple gains the research to put them into their other devices which then they learn more about interaction and the cycle continues. 

Both RIM and Microsoft research the device. That works when you are the only kid on the block or you are throwing ridiculous amounts of money at it but it does not work for long term growth. 

This is why the Zune failed, why the Playbook will have all these features but doesn't have a good experience, why the original x-box had controllers designed for bears. 

What Microsoft needs to buy is a company that can build brand loyalty through relating with their customers. RIM might also want to have a think on what makes them special and work on that as well because if there is one thing Apple knows is what they are [good at](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/#ad).
