This one is a bit shorter just because less is to be said that I already [haven't](http://worldoftomorrow.ca/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-dollhouse-edition/) [dealt](http://worldoftomorrow.ca/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-buffy-edition/) with. 

>Zoe Washburne is possibly the strongest character that Whedon ever created. The fact, too, that she is a woman of color, does not go unnoticed or unappreciated by me, especially after the Magical Negro nonsense inherent in the Primitive Slayer storyline on Buffy. 

No that was more an ancient magic thing. Still stupid in my opinion but most stories with magic in them have this so it comes with the package. 

>In Whedon’s future reality, prostitution is the a woman’s highest form of good. There’s no shortage of mentions in Firefly’s 14 episodes of how noble and prestigious Inara’s profession is. 

I seem to remember Inara's one female client is some sort of high ranking official that can afford a bodyguard for laughs. 

>In fact, the only time Inara’s profession is degraded is when a man – Mal – wants a more lasting claim put to her, his own, and asserts his arbitrary requirements and ownership over her. Think about it: every time Mal has a problem with Inara, he brings up their monetary arrangement for her leased shuttle – that’s Mal reasserting his dominance over her. Which is presented as romance.

Ugh. That feels like feminism, and not particularly good feminism at that, in the early '80s. Can I refute it sure but what is that point. If you go through life looking at every exchange between the genders as power struggle I doubt you will end up happy. Still if you want to do that go ahead. I have put up with errant solidi floating about in grammatically conspicuous places for my entire life. The overreaching arm of the patriarchy is just icing. 

Ooo icing. Maybe I should get away from the computer and go have a cupcake.
