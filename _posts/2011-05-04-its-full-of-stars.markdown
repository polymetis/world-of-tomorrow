This video perfectly encapsulates the feeling that I get around these sites in Greece after I became  familiar with the history. 

I do not mean as a tourist or, worse yet, a [Homer Thrace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054198/ "Never on a Sunday") impersonator. It is not the awe of the site itself as some sort of relic of a former era but rather the feeling of camaraderie with something that is just obstinate enough to withstand the unsympathetic march of time.
