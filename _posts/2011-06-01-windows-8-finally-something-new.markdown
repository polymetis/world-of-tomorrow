I have been complaining about Microsoft's slavish devotion to their previous UI decisions for at least 6 years but after seeing this I finally think that Microsoft may have a winner on their hands. 

That is assuming they can get [Trident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine) "IE's layout engine") and 3rd party developers and hardware manufactures on board.
