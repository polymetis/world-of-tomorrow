Not So Long Ago ...

In the Mysterious Land ...

Of Toronto, Canada ...

<p style="text-align: right;">The Globe and Mail</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://globe2go.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx">Was Dating a Printing Press</a>.</p>

Which, as you can imagine, was uncomfortable for all present. I think that is was a from the break up last year. A whirlwind romance with [Toronto Star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTVglobemedia#Reorganization_and_CHUM_Limited_merger_.282006-2010.29 "CTVglobemedia"). Really, his parents tried to help. Father Bell tried to remove all reference to what happened but it was still obvious that he was hurting.

What he did is understandable, I guess. He just did what we all do when set adrift both heartbroken and rudderless. We go for what is familiar. It's a little embarrassing but we all go through it right?

I guess it was okay for a while but now it is just getting ridiculous.  Sure it looks like he is trying to date Ipads, Androids, and I think I even saw him flirting with a Kindle but really every night he goes home and sits there are thinking about the printing press as his true love. Ugg this mourning period is taking too long.

I heard, while the snowstorm was in the 'States, that Rupert Murdock and the Ipad were getting a little serious. I know they had a big party to celebrate their new found relationship and I have to admit that those two getting together seemed like it would be interesting enough so I gave it look. Even if it was just out of morbid curiosity.

Gah it was worse than the Globe and Mail. Murdock was treating her like a type glossy printing press but cheaper and faster.

What is the obsession with News men wanting to date printing presses? I can understand the outfit and all but it is all kinda of ridiculous at this point. Haven't we all grown up enough to not be messing with Gutenburg's daughter.

But back to the Globe and Mail specifically as he is my friend.

I think he's really got to start to grow up and move on. We all indulged it for a while but I am not sure it is healthy. Murdock knows that he has to move on but the cosplay is a little creepy. Don't you think it's time both them start to forget their old sweet hearts and try to date someone new?
