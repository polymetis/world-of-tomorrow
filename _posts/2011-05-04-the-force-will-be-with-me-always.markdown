As many of my friends know I don't particularly like Star Wars. I mock the prequels openly -- I have yet to see the [second one in english](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/ "Saw it in german") actually -- and even think the originals are that cinematically important. Sit me down with the [*Third Man*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959/) a thousand times over any of the Star Wars films. 

But I have a secret. 

In my youth I was a bit of Star Wars fan and this is my story of that very first time I saw [*A New Hope*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/) at the behest of [Lisa Foiles](http://www.lisafoiles.com/ "Her Landing Page - Article is in the Title"). 

I had managed to avoid Star Wars for a great deal of my life. My mother was a Star Trek fan and thought all over science fiction was necessarily flawed for not being Star Trek. Not a big deal for kid honestly. In reality you just want something to make you smile and to even spend some time with your very busy parents. 

In my younger years I watched all the Star Trek shows that I could with my mother and it seems to have served as a bit of bonding experience in my memory. Those may have been some of the better years of our relationship but, as most young people get, I became overly defensive of the Star Trek mythos simply because it was a defence of my mother. 

Eventually, around the age of 12, I made a friend that calling him a huge Star Wars fan would not do him justice. We would fight about the merits of the two series without knowing the other side of argument. To his credit he started watching reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation and started to grant that it had some merit. So out of deference to fairness I agreed to watch his THX remastered VHS collection some weekend. 

I was blown away but the story and effects. This was world that had the type of graduer Disney stories but was a little more grown up but there were laser swords. I instantly became a fan in the way that a 12 year old can be. 

Now my history of being *Down and Out with George Lucas* is not one that needs to be recounted today, or really ever, but I do have to admit that still after all this time when I hear the opening few bars of John Williams main theme a quick smile crosses my face. That is the smile of my 12 year old self with all the total and fevered happiness that innocence can bring. 

For that I am and always will be thankful for Star Wars because even after the miles I have put myself through it can still smile and feel like that 12 year old boy. Even if only for second.
