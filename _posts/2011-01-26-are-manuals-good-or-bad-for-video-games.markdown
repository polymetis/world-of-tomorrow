As I was reading [this](http://kotaku.com/5743936/the-flimsy-mass-effect-2-instruction-manual-one-year-later "kotaku")this about the fact that video game manuals are falling into disrepair I began to wonder if manuals were good for video games as an art form.

I understand in that in the eighties it was not only necessary but prudent to have instructions because almost every game was different in its play style and tutorials didn't quite exist in game until the early nineties, if memory serves. The manual was there to make sure we could make sense of the pixelated world.

Today, on the other hand, most games follow a controller scheme that has more or less the same relative button positions across the genre and even the platforms. When a developer thinks he knows better there is backlash. Just think how obnoxious it is to hold x(playstation version) to run in ﻿Batman Arkham Asylum despite the fact there was a good reason for it - you wouldn't want to accidentally run in a stealth game now would you.  Even with the standard conventions there are still lengthy tutorials through out most games. There is always a chance to learn what the new do-hicky does and how to use it.

Beyond that, video games tell their story in-game through a more cinematic means that were not available during the 8 and 16 bit eras. There is no longer a need for a preamble paragraph to explain the game with you have opening cinematic and voice acting.

All of this makes the manual not a particularly useful thing in practical terms and to be honest most of the time I don't even look at the things but is it necessarily a good idea to take the player out of an immersive experience to teach them to play the game ? Some games treat it as part of the early exposition, others prefer a tutorial level or section which is either outside the main story or a very small section of it, or just constantly reminding the player of what buttons to press.

All these techniques sacrifice some immersion for the sake of playability but which is best? To be honest I think the manual was the best solution just because it is completely outside the players experience, during the in-game story, and to be fair most players will figure out the controls without a tutorial in a few attempts anyway but it is simply nice to have the reference.
