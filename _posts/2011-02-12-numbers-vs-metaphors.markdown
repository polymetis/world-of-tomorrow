This morning I was just filtering through the news feeds about Egypt and I noticed an extraordinary quote. It seemed simple enough. [John Simpson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12437827 "Egyptians celebrate a new era in history"), of the BBC, simply put that Egypt was for the first time in 5000 years getting to pick their leader.

This is fine enough but I don't think that the scale is really communicated through this line and with a quick google search people seem to like to toss around the [5000 year idea](http://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=5000+years+egypt&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=H6JWTbbrOsnOgAeNiZmGDQ).

What I think communicates the scale of what is going on would be to say "For the first time in recorded history Egyptians will pick their leader."

In my minds eye, or whatever, I can imagine myself in the large cavernous library that would be required to contain all that is history. I can see all the books. I can feel the very weight of the crumbled statue of ﻿Ozymandias and more importantly I can hear the echos of jubilant celebration reflecting against all of this.

Maybe its just me but I think the metaphor of saying that in all that has been written this has not be written before is more powerful an image than simply saying the number. Then again I could be wrong, maybe the number is better for a society that is so math obsessed. Opinions?
