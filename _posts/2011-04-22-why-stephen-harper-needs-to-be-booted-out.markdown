title: "Why Steven Harper Should Be Booted Out"
lead: "Let me clear the air. I am not strongly affiliated with any party. Instead I have tendency to vote for the best candiate in my riding. Living in Halifax's south end this means that I have voted for the incomparable Alexa McDonough and Megan Leslie more recently but in my past, when I lived in Guelph, I voted for a Conservative candiate because the Liberal candidate was an empty shirt."

Let me clear the air. I am not strongly affiliated with any party. Instead I have tendency to vote for the best candiate in my riding. Living in Halifax's south end this means that I have voted for the incomparable Alexa McDonough and Megan Leslie more recently but in my past, when I lived in Guelph, I voted for a Conservative candiate because the Liberal candidate was an empty shirt.

The only party leader I like is Ignatieff and I sincerely hope that the Liberals take a majority government again despite the fact that my vote will not be cast for the Liberal candiate in my riding -- well maybe I have yet to decide. 

None of this is why I think Harper should be booted to curb. My reasons for that is because he is *a* **dismal** ***failure***.  

I am not referring to his inability to form a majority government, nor do I refer to the economic crisis, and I am most certainly not referring to anything, directly, that is on [shitharperdid.ca](http://www.shitharperdid.ca/). 

No, I am referring to his failure to unite the three sisters of canadian conservatism. I hear some of you asking "who the hell are they" in future perfect land so let me explain. 

Before Harper was Prime Minister he used to wax poetic on the three zones of strong canadian conservatism. These zones were the west (quelle surprise), the centre, and the atlantic peoples. His challenge was that these three needed to be united so that a true Canadian conservatism could represent the truest nature of Canadians (I am paraphrasing of course).

All of this was from his days editing Knoff's essays and hanging out in Alberta and is not really google friendly but if you go to any university library and look over the Canadian Political Science journals you will find these ideas floating around his name. So I do not think that it is unfair of me to say that he should have had this on agenda at some point in the last 6 years. Furthermore, considering that this is *his own* goal for *his own* party this should have be an easy thing for him to put in the win column.

Well he didn't succeed. He tried to play nice with the atlantic people, surely reminiscing as to how the centre just ignores the west and the east (wah!), by elevating Peter Mackay's star. I think that worked well for Mackay but I don't really think that really did the trick for the Atlantic region in general. 

Then there are all the cabinet reshuffles as he tries to maintain control over his own party and with each iteration he attempts to have stronger and stronger *personal control* over the fold. 

This is the image of a man that is barley in control of himself. This is also the image of man that I don't think should continue to be prime minster. 

In short, too late I know, Harper should be voted out of office just so the Conservative party can get someone better. I mean really I feel sorry for them but my sympathy for the Tories of the country is not the only reason I think this. 

It is good to have actual debate in the house of commons and Haper is not the man to have on either side of the aisle. There is dire need for new blood so we, as a country, can move forward. 

Perhaps next time the Tories can find more successful and certainly more charming leader. That would be good for the party at least, and perhaps even the country as whole.
